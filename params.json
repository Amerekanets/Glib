{"name":"Glib","tagline":"A simple general purpose C# library covering windows forms, XNA, extension methods, and more.","body":"## Welcome to Glib\r\nThis library simplifies usage of various APIs available in C#, such as XNA, Windows Forms, and conversions to common types, such as integer. For example, to parse a string as an integer, you can just run: `\"Your string\".ToInt()`.\r\n\r\n## Users of our library\r\nThis library is currently being used by:\r\n* [PGCGame](https://github.com/GreatMindsRobotics/PGCGame)\r\n\r\nIf you are using this library and want to be on this page, please contact @glen3b.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n### Cross-platform binaries\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/x86/GlenLibrary.dll\">Desktop DLL</a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/x86/GlenLibrary.xml\">Desktop documentation</a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/x86/GlibXbox.dll\">XBOX DLL</a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/raw/master/Binaries/x86/GlibXbox.XML\">XBOX documentation</a>\r\n\r\n## Building from source\r\nTo build this library from source, you need a C# compiler at least (I recommend getting the IDE [Visual C# express 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709939)) and, to build the full library (including XNA components), [XNA game studio 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=23714) or [later](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=27599). This project includes a Visual Studio C# Express 2010 solution file. To not include XNA components, delete the XNA folder in your copy. Be sure not to include that change in a pull request!\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nDocs are available as XML documentation when you build the project, or are in development on the [wiki](https://github.com/glen3b/Glib/wiki).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
